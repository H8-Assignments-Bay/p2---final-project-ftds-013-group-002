## Introduction
Online shoppers are faced by a challenge when determining which product to buy. The availability of huge amount of price options can be staggering for those who wants to reap the most benefit of buying goods online. Also, since cheaper products don't always lead to higher product qualities, keeping both price and customer reviews in check can be a lot of homework for online shoppers. And that's the primary reason of us developing our current project. This project will cover the subject of 'Comparison Shopping Engine' that can help online customers to pick which product to buy, it also can be used by retailers or dropshipers to determine their pricing strategy through looking at the current market information.
